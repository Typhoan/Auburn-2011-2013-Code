Overview:
The project was to create a teller terminal system that must keep track of all admin,
branch staff, and clients. Admins may create, delete, and modify clients, and branch staff.
While branch staff can only create and modify clients. 

To Compile:

I used the Cygwyn Libraries on Windows 7. The Code should work on other computers with g++
