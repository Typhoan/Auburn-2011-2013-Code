Project 4

Three files required
-Brute
-Fast
-Point

To Run
-Takes two command-line arguments, the txt name and whether to output lines

Sample Run
-java Brute input8.txt -v
	Plots and outputs all possible lines
-java Brute input8.txt 
	Just plots

Problem Statements
- Given a set of N distinct points in the plane, identify and draw every maximal 
	line segment that connects a subset of four or more of the points. Each point 
	will be specified by an (x, y) pair where x and y are double values 
	in the range 0 to 32,767.

Brute
-Takes the brute force method to find all possible lines from the text file. 
-Worst case O(N^4)
-Uses O(N) space

Fast
-Uses sort method to quickly find all possible lines from the text file.
-Worst case O((N^2)*log(N))
-Uses O(N) space

Point
-provides methods to find lines

Also one sample file is provided along with a picture of the plotted lines.
