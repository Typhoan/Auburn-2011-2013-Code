Overview:

The Goal of the project was to create a simple text game to get to the end of the hall
of Shelby Center (Software Engineering Building). The player starts with a random amount
of time, intelligence, and money. While playing the game time will be decreased and the 
other stats will be affected based of the random events in the game. Once the player 
is finished the score is calculated and recorded if it makes the highscores. 

To Compile:

I used the Cygwyn Libraries on Windows 7. The Code should work on other computers with g++
